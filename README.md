# The Buzz

## Overview

The Buzz was a social media platform that allowed users to connect, share posts, and interact with each other through comments and likes. Unfortunately, the app is no longer functional as the backend server has been taken down. Despite this, the frontend code remains available for viewing, showcasing the design and architecture of the app.

While the app is not currently working, it serves as a demonstration of my skills in full-stack web development, specifically using modern web frameworks and tools.

## Technologies Used

## Backend Breakdown

Node.js with Express: Used for building the API and handling server requests.

ElephantSQL: A NoSQL database used for storing user information, posts, and other data.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens were used to handle user authentication and secure routes.

Socket.io: Implemented for real-time features like live notifications and messaging.

## Features

User Authentication: Users could sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Posting and Interacting: Users could create posts, comment on posts, and like content from other users.

Real-Time Notifications: Notifications for likes, comments, and follows were delivered using Socket.io.

Responsive Design: The app was fully responsive, ensuring usability across different devices.

## Current Status

Unfortunately, The Buzz is no longer functional because the backend server has been decommissioned. There are further directions in the web README.md that might let you run the frontend locally. The mobile also only has the source code in it, not any of the build files or any other files. Sadly that was lost when the project was closed.
